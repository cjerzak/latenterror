Description: An R package for analyzing latent variable models with measurement 
    error correction. It provides tools for implementing various correction methods 
    for measurement error in latent variables, uses bootstrapping for robust 
    estimation of standard errors, and offers both OLS and IV-based approaches. 
    The package allows for flexible specification of observable indicators and 
    groupings, making it suitable for a wide range of latent variable analyses 
    in social sciences and other fields.
